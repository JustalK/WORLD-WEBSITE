# PERSONNAL WEBSITE

This project is a website for presenting myself and testing the limit of GLSL. The website has been build using `React-Three-Fiber` and `Troika` for managing the text inside the canvas. I have not spent too much time yet and the refactoring or processes. The code might be a little messy for the moment since I am still experimenting.
